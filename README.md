# Convex Optimization Thin Airfoils

This repository contains the code for the "Novel Airfoil for Improved Supersonic Aerodynamic Performance" paper.

## About

This project focuses on developing a novel airfoil design using convex optimization techniques to enhance supersonic aerodynamic performance. The code provided in this repository implements the algorithms and methods described in the paper.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- **AIRFOILS COORDS:** This directory contains the coordinates of the airfoils used in the optimization process.
- **DATA:** This directory stores the data files generated during the optimization process.
- **FIGURES:** This directory contains the figures and plots generated from the optimization results.
- **utilis:** This directory includes utility functions and scripts used in the optimization process.
- **main.m:** This is the main MATLAB script that executes the convex optimization process.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:'''git clone https://github.com/zmanaa/Convex-Optimization_Thin-Airfoils.git'''
2. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
4. Run the `main.m` script to execute the convex optimization process.
